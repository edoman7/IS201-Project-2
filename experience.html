                         <p>Nanny
                            <br>I was a contracted nanny for 3 years. I began my job when the 3 children in my care were 4 months old, and then 3 and 7 years old. 
                            They became some of my best friends and I made many memories with them. They are still my pride and joy even though I don't get to see them 
                            everyday like in years past. 
                         </p>
                         <p>Draper Mayor's Youth Council
                            <br>The city Mayor's Youth Council provided me with an opportunity to serve my community. I got to help plan and carry out many city events, serve 
                            the community in creative ways like cleaning the cemetary headstones, particpate in a variety of service projects
                             and got to learn more about how city governments operate.
                         </p>
                         <p>Burgess Owen's Internship
                            <br>I got to intern with Utah's 4th District Congressman, Burgess Owens, on his reelection campaign. Here I got to assit 
                            with his campagin for the 2022 election. I aided with meet and greets, delievered requested yard signs, made phone calls for the
                            repulican caucuss, and helped at state election events. I witnessed first hand how important government officials are to the success of 
                            our everyday lives and learned how to communicate peacefully with opposing and non-opposing constituents. 
                         </p>
                         <p>Seminary Council
                            <br>Serving on seminary council at my local high school provided me with even more service opportunities. I worked
                            closely with the teachers to plan events, activities, service projects, devotionals, monthly challenges, and lessons that would 
                            uplift and encourage the seminary students to build lasting relationships with each other and with the Lord.
